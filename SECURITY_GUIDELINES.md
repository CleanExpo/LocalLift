# LocalLift CRM Security Guidelines

This document outlines comprehensive security measures that should be implemented before finalizing the LocalLift CRM application for production use.

## Authentication & Access Control

### Authentication Security

- [x] **Password Policies**
  - Minimum password length: 10 characters
  - Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
  - Prevent the use of common passwords
  - Implement password expiration (every 90 days)
  - Limit failed login attempts to 5 before temporary account lockout

- [x] **JWT Security**
  - Short token expiration time (1 hour)
  - Implement refresh token rotation
  - Include user role claims in the token payload
  - Use secure, httpOnly cookies for token storage
  - Set proper CORS policies to prevent cross-site request forgery
  
- [ ] **Multi-Factor Authentication**
  - Implement MFA for all admin and superadmin accounts
  - Support email verification codes
  - Support authenticator app integration
  - Require MFA for sensitive operations

### Role-Based Access Control

- [x] **Role Enforcement**
  - Verify permission checks on all API endpoints
  - Implement Row Level Security at the database level
  - Log all permission changes and escalations
  - Implement principle of least privilege

- [ ] **Session Management**
  - Implement session timeout (30 minutes of inactivity)
  - Allow users to view and terminate their active sessions
  - Record login IPs and notify on unusual locations
  - Invalidate all sessions when passwords are changed

## Network & Infrastructure Security

### Transport Security

- [ ] **HTTPS Configuration**
  - Force HTTPS on all connections
  - Implement HSTS headers
  - Configure secure TLS (1.2+) settings
  - Use proper SSL certificates from trusted authorities
  - Set secure cookie attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)

- [ ] **API Security**
  - Rate limiting to prevent brute force and DoS attacks
  - API keys for third-party integrations
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Content Security Policy headers
  - Protection against common attack vectors (OWASP Top 10)

### Infrastructure Security

- [ ] **Hosting Configuration**
  - Harden Railway deployment environment
  - Enable Vercel security features
  - Configure proper database connection security
  - Keep all dependencies up to date
  - Implement automated security scanning

- [ ] **Firewall & Network Security**
  - Configure IP whitelisting for admin dashboard access
  - Database access limited to application servers only
  - Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  - Block suspicious traffic patterns
  - Monitor for unusual access patterns

## Data Security

### Database Security

- [x] **Supabase Security**
  - Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies
  - Enable connection encryption
  - Implement proper database user roles and permissions
  - Regular backup procedures
  - Data validation at the database level

- [ ] **Encryption**
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
  - Use strong encryption algorithms
  - Implement secure key management
  - Encrypt backups
  - Consider client-side encryption for critical fields

### Data Handling

- [ ] **PII Management**
  - Implement proper handling of Personally Identifiable Information
  - Compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, Australian Privacy Principles)
  - Data minimization practices
  - Clear data retention policies
  - User consent management
  
- [ ] **Logging & Monitoring**
  - Implement secure audit logs
  - Monitor for suspicious activities
  - Regular log analysis
  - Alerting on security events
  - Log retention compliance

## International Considerations

### Global Compliance

- [ ] **Privacy Regulations**
  - Australian Privacy Principles compliance
  - GDPR compliance for European users
  - CCPA compliance for California users
  - Canadian PIPEDA compliance
  - Data localization considerations

- [ ] **Regional Security Standards**
  - ISO 27001 compliance guidelines
  - SOC 2 compliance considerations
  - Industry-specific regulations as applicable
  - Regional data protection standards

### Global Accessibility

- [ ] **Localization Security**
  - Proper encoding to prevent injection attacks
  - Secure handling of international character sets
  - Timezone-aware security monitoring
  - Multi-language input validation

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Before Launch)

1. Enable HTTPS for all traffic
2. Verify authentication security settings
3. Test RBAC enforcement on all endpoints
4. Ensure secure database connection
5. Implement basic logging and monitoring
6. Update privacy policy with international compliance

### Short-term Actions (First Month)

1. Implement MFA for admin accounts
2. Configure session management settings
3. Set up regular security scanning
4. Deploy WAF protection
5. Establish backup procedures
6. Conduct initial security audit

### Long-term Actions (Continuous)

1. Regular penetration testing
2. Security training for administrators
3. Periodic security reviews
4. Stay up-to-date with security patches
5. Evolve security measures with changing threats
6. Implement user security awareness features

## Security Documentation

Maintain the following security documentation:

1. **Security Policy**: Overall security approach
2. **Incident Response Plan**: Steps to take in case of a breach
3. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Recovering from catastrophic failures
4. **User Security Guide**: Security guidelines for users

## Responsible Disclosure

Implement a responsible disclosure policy to allow security researchers to report vulnerabilities in a structured way.
