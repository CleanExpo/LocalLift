# Password Special Character Issue Resolution

## Issue Identified:

I've identified a critical issue that could be causing the database connection problems. The password for Supabase contains a special character (`@`) which requires special handling in connection strings.

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated Database Password**: 
   - Original password: `Sanctuary2025!`
   - Correct password: `Sanctuary2025!@`

2. **Fixed DATABASE_URL Encoding**:
   - The `@` symbol in passwords needs to be URL-encoded as `%40` when used in a connection string
   - Updated DATABASE_URL to: `postgresql://postgres:Sanctuary2025!%40@52.0.91.163:5432/postgres?sslmode=require`

3. **Updated Files**:
   - `.env.railway`: Updated with correct password and encoded DATABASE_URL
   - `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`: Updated documentation to reflect correct values
   - `connection_test.py`: Updated test script with correct password
   - `fixed_connection.py`: Added special handling note for passwords with special characters

## Why This Matters:

In database connection strings, the `@` symbol has a special meaning - it separates the authentication information from the host. When a password contains an `@`, it must be properly encoded to prevent the database driver from misinterpreting it as a separator.

For example:
- Incorrect: `postgresql://postgres:Sanctuary2025!@52.0.91.163:5432/postgres`
  - This will be interpreted as username "postgres" with password "Sanctuary2025!" connecting to host "52.0.91.163"

- Correct: `postgresql://postgres:Sanctuary2025!%40@52.0.91.163:5432/postgres`
  - This will be interpreted as username "postgres" with password "Sanctuary2025!@" connecting to host "52.0.91.163"

## Next Steps:

1. **Update Railway Environment Variables**:
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Set the corrected environment variables:
     ```
     SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=Sanctuary2025!@
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:Sanctuary2025!%40@52.0.91.163:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
     ```

2. **Deploy with Updated Values**:
   - Deploy a new instance with these corrected values
   - This should resolve the connection issue

3. **Run Connection Test**:
   - Use the updated `connection_test.py` script to verify the connection works

This correction should resolve the database connection issue, allowing the application to successfully connect to Supabase.
