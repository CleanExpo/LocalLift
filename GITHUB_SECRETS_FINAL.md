# Final GitHub Secrets Configuration

This document provides the final values for setting up your GitHub Secrets for CI/CD automation.

## Required GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository at [github.com/CleanExpo/LocalLift](https://github.com/CleanExpo/LocalLift):

### 1. RAILWAY_TOKEN

```
p 0e58b112-f5f5-4285-ad1f-f47d1481045b
```

This token allows GitHub Actions to deploy your backend to Railway.

### 2. VERCEL_TOKEN

```
jtqL60Dymmd2bbAttw1Yl3ga
```

This token allows GitHub Actions to deploy your frontend to Vercel.

### 3. VERCEL_ORG_ID

To find your organization ID, look at your Vercel dashboard URL:
- Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Look for the value after `?orgId=` in the URL
- Example: `team_XXXXXXX` or `org_XXXXXXX`

### 4. VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

To find your project ID:
- Go to Vercel dashboard → LocalLift project
- Go to "Settings" tab
- Look for "Project ID" (typically a value like `prj_XXXXXXXX`)

## How to Add GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add each of the four secrets above with their corresponding values

## Verification

Once all four secrets are added, your GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline will be enabled. Any push to the main branch will automatically:

1. Deploy the backend to Railway
2. Deploy the frontend to Vercel
3. Run validation checks
4. Report deployment status

## Deployment URLs

- Frontend: https://local-lift-5wus1j15e-admin-cleanexpo247s-projects.vercel.app
- Backend API: https://locallift-production.up.railway.app
