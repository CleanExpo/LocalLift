# Vercel Access Update

After attempting to update Vercel settings by changing:
- Pre-Production Deployments = Default
- Production Deployments = off

We're still encountering the login screen when accessing the deployed application at https://local-lift-5wus1j15e-admin-cleanexpo247s-projects.vercel.app.

## Additional Troubleshooting Steps

Since the initial configuration changes didn't resolve the access issue, here are additional steps to try:

### 1. Check Project Privacy Settings

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → LocalLift project
2. Navigate to Settings → General
3. Locate the "Privacy" section
4. Ensure it's set to "Public" (not "Private" or "Team")
5. Save changes

### 2. Verify Domain Settings

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → LocalLift project
2. Navigate to Settings → Domains
3. Confirm domains are properly configured
4. Consider adding a custom domain if needed

### 3. Try Force Deployment

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → LocalLift project
2. Navigate to Deployments
3. Click on the most recent deployment
4. Select "Redeploy" from the menu (three dots)
5. Choose "Redeploy from Source"

### 4. Check Authentication Settings

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → LocalLift project
2. Navigate to Settings → Authentication
3. Ensure no unwanted authentication requirements are enabled

### 5. Verify Team/Account Permissions

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Team Settings
2. Check if the project has correct team access settings
3. Ensure your account has proper access rights

### 6. Consider Preview Deployments URL

If the production URL continues to require login, try using the preview deployment URL:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → LocalLift project
2. Navigate to Deployments
3. Find the latest successful deployment
4. Use the preview URL provided (typically ends with `.vercel.app`)

### 7. Contact Vercel Support

If all else fails, you may need to contact Vercel support:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/support
2. Submit a ticket describing the issue
3. Include your project ID and deployment details

## Next Steps

Once access is resolved, we can proceed with implementing the landing page UI/UX improvements outlined in LANDING_PAGE_ENHANCEMENT.md.
