# Next Steps: Setting up CI/CD for LocalLift

Now that you've successfully committed all the LocalLift deployment files to GitHub, the next step is to set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions. This document walks you through the process.

## 1. Access Your GitHub Repository

Go to your repository at https://github.com/CleanExpo/LocalLift

## 2. Set Up GitHub Secrets

GitHub Secrets are required for the deployment workflow to authenticate with Railway and Vercel. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Settings" tab in your GitHub repository
2. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret" to add each of the required secrets

### Required Secrets

You need to set up the following four secrets:

#### a. RAILWAY_TOKEN

This token allows GitHub Actions to deploy to Railway.

- Install Railway CLI: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
- Log in: `railway login`
- Find your token in:
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/.railway/config.json`
  - macOS/Linux: `~/.railway/config.json`
- Copy the `token` value and add it as a secret named `RAILWAY_TOKEN`

#### b. VERCEL_TOKEN

This token allows GitHub Actions to deploy to Vercel.

- Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Click on your profile picture → Settings
- Go to "Tokens" section
- Create a new token named "LocalLift GitHub Actions"
- Set scope to "Full Access"
- Copy the token and add it as a secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN`

#### c. VERCEL_ORG_ID

- Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Click on your organization name in the top-left
- Look at the URL in your browser: `https://vercel.com/[org-name]?[org-id]`
- Copy the `org-id` value (after the `?` character)
- Add it as a secret named `VERCEL_ORG_ID`

#### d. VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

- Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Select the LocalLift project
- Go to "Settings" tab
- Scroll down to find "Project ID"
- Copy this value and add it as a secret named `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

## 3. Verify GitHub Actions Setup

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. You should see the "Deploy LocalLift" workflow
3. Click on it to view the workflow details

## 4. Trigger Your First Deployment

Make a small change to your repository and push it to the main branch:

```
# Edit a file, for example update the README.md with a small change
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger first automated deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 5. Monitor the Deployment

1. Go back to the "Actions" tab
2. You should see a new workflow run in progress
3. Click on it to view the details and logs

## 6. Verify Deployment Success

After the workflow completes successfully:

1. Visit your Railway deployment to verify the backend is working
2. Visit your Vercel deployment to verify the frontend is working

## Troubleshooting

If your deployment fails, check the following:

1. Ensure all four secrets are correctly set up in GitHub
2. Verify the correct permissions for both Railway and Vercel tokens
3. Check the Actions logs for specific error messages
4. Consult the `github_secrets_setup.md` file for more detailed instructions

## Next Steps

Once your CI/CD pipeline is working:

1. Make improvements to your codebase
2. Push changes to GitHub
3. Let GitHub Actions automatically deploy your changes
4. Monitor deployments in the GitHub Actions tab

For more information, refer to the following documentation:
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_GUIDE.md`
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`

Your LocalLift application is now set up for modern, automated deployments!
