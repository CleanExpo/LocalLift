# Railway PORT Configuration Fix Instructions

Based on Railway's documentation and your feedback, I've identified that the deployment issue is likely related to the PORT configuration. According to [Railway's networking documentation](https://docs.railway.com/guides/public-networking#railway-provided-domain), applications must listen on the PORT environment variable to be accessible via a Railway domain.

## Step 1: Run the PORT Fix Script

I've created a specialized script that focuses specifically on fixing PORT-related issues:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift
python fix_port_railway.py
```

This script will:
- Find your application's entry point file
- Update it to properly use the PORT environment variable
- Create a correctly configured `railway.toml` and `Procfile`
- If no suitable entry file is found, create a simple server file that works with Railway

## Step 2: Review the Changes

After running the script, review the changes it made:

1. Check the updated or created entry file (likely `main.py` or `railway_entry.py`)
2. Verify that the `Procfile` contains a line like: `web: python <entry_file>.py`
3. Verify that `railway.toml` has been created or updated with proper settings

## Step 3: Deploy to Railway

Deploy the updated application to Railway:

1. Go to the Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/project/0e58b112-f5f5-4285-ad1f-f47d1481045b/
2. Navigate to your service ("humorous-serenity")
3. Click on the "Deployments" tab
4. Click the "Deploy" button to create a new deployment

## Step 4: Monitor the Deployment

1. Watch the deployment logs for any errors
2. Make sure your application starts successfully and listens on the PORT environment variable
3. Look for lines in the log indicating the server is running, like:
   ```
   Starting server on 0.0.0.0:8080
   INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
   ```

## Step 5: Test the Application

Once the deployment is complete:

1. Test the health endpoint: https://local-lift-production.up.railway.app/health
2. If that works, test the main application: https://local-lift-production.up.railway.app

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the logs in Railway for any specific error messages
2. Make sure the PORT environment variable is set in Railway (it should be by default)
3. Verify that your application is actually listening on the PORT environment variable
4. Try running the `railway_deployment_fix.py` script which fixes additional issues beyond just PORT

## What If This Doesn't Work?

If these automated fixes don't resolve the issue, a fallback approach is to:

1. Create a minimal FastAPI application in a new file (like `railway_entry.py`)
2. Update your Procfile to use this new file
3. Deploy this minimal version to Railway to verify basic connectivity
4. Once that works, gradually add back your application's functionality

The `fix_port_railway.py` script will do this automatically if it can't find a suitable entry file.
