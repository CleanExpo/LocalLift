# LocalLift Landing Page Access Issue

When attempting to view the LocalLift landing page at the Vercel deployment URL, we encountered an access issue. Instead of seeing the LocalLift website, we're getting the Vercel login screen.

## Issue Details

- **Current URL**: https://local-lift-5wus1j15e-admin-cleanexpo247s-projects.vercel.app
- **Expected**: LocalLift landing page with navigation and content
- **Actual**: Vercel login screen
- **Console Errors**: 
  - Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 ()
  - Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ()

## Potential Causes

1. **Project Visibility Settings**: The Vercel project might be set to private/team-only visibility instead of public.
2. **Deployment Status**: The deployment might not have completed successfully.
3. **Domain Configuration**: The custom domain settings might need to be adjusted.
4. **Authentication Requirements**: The project might require authentication to access.

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Update Vercel Project Settings**:
   - Log in to your Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to your LocalLift project
   - Go to Settings > General
   - Ensure "Privacy" is set to "Public" (not "Private" or "Team")

2. **Check Deployment Status**:
   - In your Vercel dashboard, check if the deployment shows as "Complete" with a green checkmark
   - If not, you may need to trigger a new deployment

3. **Verify Domain Configuration**:
   - In Vercel settings, go to Domains
   - Make sure your domain is properly configured
   - If using a custom domain, ensure DNS settings are correct

4. **Review Production Branch**:
   - Make sure the production branch in Vercel settings matches your main GitHub branch

## Next Steps

Once you've made these changes, the site should be publicly accessible without requiring a Vercel login. You would then be able to view and assess the landing page for any design or content updates you might want to make.

If you're still experiencing issues after making these changes, please let me know and we can explore other potential solutions.
