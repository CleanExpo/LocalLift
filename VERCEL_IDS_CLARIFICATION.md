# Vercel ID Clarification

Based on your question about the VERCEL_ORG_ID, I need to provide some clarification on how to correctly find the Vercel Organization ID and Project ID.

## Finding Your Vercel Organization ID

The URL you provided (`https://vercel.com/admin-cleanexpo247s-projects/local-lift`) is your project URL, not the organization ID.

To find your organization ID:

1. Go to the Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar
3. You should see something like:
   ```
   https://vercel.com/admin-cleanexpo247s-projects?orgId=team_XXXXXXX
   ```
4. The organization ID is the value after `orgId=`
   - For example, it might look like `team_AbCdEfGh12345` or similar

## Finding Your Vercel Project ID

For the project ID:

1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on the "LocalLift" project
3. Click on the "Settings" tab
4. Scroll down to find "Project ID"
5. It will look something like `prj_XXXXXXXXXX`

## GitHub Secrets Format

When adding these to GitHub Secrets, you should use only the ID values, not the full URLs:

- **VERCEL_ORG_ID**: Use only the ID portion (e.g., `team_AbCdEfGh12345`)
- **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**: Use only the ID portion (e.g., `prj_XXXXXXXXXX`)

Along with the tokens we already have:
- **RAILWAY_TOKEN**: `p 0e58b112-f5f5-4285-ad1f-f47d1481045b`
- **VERCEL_TOKEN**: `jtqL60Dymmd2bbAttw1Yl3ga`

## Need Help?

If you're having trouble finding these values, you can check your browser's address bar when in the Vercel dashboard, or try clicking on different projects or settings pages to see if the `orgId` parameter appears in the URL.
