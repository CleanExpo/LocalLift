# Railway PORT Configuration Fix

This document outlines the changes made to ensure the LocalLift application properly listens on the PORT environment variable required by Railway.

## Changes Made

1. Fixed the main entry point file (main.py):
   - Corrected the uvicorn.run() command to properly use the PORT environment variable
   - Set default port to 8080 if PORT environment variable is not provided
   - Added logging to show which port and host the server is starting on
   - Removed duplicate health endpoint

2. Verified and updated configuration files:
   - Procfile is correctly set to `web: python main.py`
   - railway.toml includes proper configuration:
     ```
     [build]
     builder = "nixpacks"

     [deploy]
     startCommand = "python main.py"
     healthcheckPath = "/health"
     healthcheckTimeout = 30
     restartPolicyType = "always"
     ```

## Verification Steps

After deployment to Railway, verify proper PORT configuration by:

1. Check the deployment logs for a line similar to:
   ```
   Starting server on 0.0.0.0:8080
   ```

2. Test the health endpoint:
   ```
   https://local-lift-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```
   It should return a simple "ok" response.

3. If you need to manually override the PORT, you can do so in Railway's environment variables section.

## Troubleshooting

If deployment issues persist:

1. Verify the PORT environment variable is set in Railway (it should be by default)
2. Check for any errors in the Railway deployment logs
3. Ensure your application is correctly binding to 0.0.0.0 (not 127.0.0.1 or localhost)
4. If necessary, run the fix_port_railway.py script again
