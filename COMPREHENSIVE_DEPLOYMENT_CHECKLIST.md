2. Check CORS configuration in backend
3. Confirm Railway service is running
4. Test API endpoint directly with curl or Postman

### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify connection string format
2. Check IP allowlist in Supabase
3. Confirm database credentials
4. Test connection with `psql` or another client

### Authentication Problems
1. Verify JWT secret matches between frontend and backend
2. Check token expiration settings
3. Confirm login endpoint working properly
4. Test with curl or Postman directly

### Deployment Pipeline Failures
1. Check git branch configuration
2. Verify build scripts
3. Look for dependency issues
4. Check environment variables configuration
