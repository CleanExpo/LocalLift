# Unicode Fix for Deployment Automation

During testing of the deployment automation system, we encountered issues with Unicode characters in PowerShell and Python's console output. The Windows command prompt uses codepage 1252 by default, which doesn't support many Unicode characters like checkmarks (✅) and warning symbols (⚠️).

## Fixed Files Created

To resolve these issues, the following fixed files have been created:

1. **Fixed Python Script**: `LocalLift/deployment-automation/src/auto_deployment_fixer_fixed.py`
   - Replaced Unicode characters with ASCII alternatives
   - Changed ✅/❌ symbols to [OK]/[NO] text indicators
   - Ensures compatibility with any console codepage

2. **Fixed PowerShell Script**: `LocalLift/deployment-automation/run_auto_deployment_fixed.ps1`
   - Uses the fixed Python script
   - Sets proper console output encoding
   - Handles output capturing and display properly
   - Creates deployment logs with compatible character encoding

## How to Use the Fixed Version

The fixed deployment automation should be run using the absolute path instructions provided in the ABSOLUTE_PATH_INSTRUCTIONS.md file.

Example command for running from anywhere (including system32):

```powershell
& "C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\run_auto_deployment_fixed.ps1"
```

## Error Details

The original error was:

```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2705' in position 0: character maps to <undefined>
```

This occurred because the Python script was attempting to output Unicode characters (specifically the ✅ character with code U+2705) to a console that was using a character encoding that doesn't support those characters.

## Technical Background

- Windows command prompt typically uses codepage 1252 (Western European)
- Python inherits this encoding for stdout/stderr
- PowerShell can handle Unicode better, but there are issues when capturing output from external programs
- The fix ensures all character output is compatible with basic ASCII, which is universally supported

## Update Note

All documentation has been updated to reference the fixed scripts. The DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md now directs users to use these fixed versions to avoid encoding issues during deployment automation execution.
