# LocalLift Deployment Completion Guide

**Date: April 20, 2025**  
**Version: 1.1.0**

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for managing and maintaining your LocalLift deployment infrastructure using the automated MCP (Model Context Protocol) powered tooling that has been set up.

## Current Deployment Status

| Component | Status | Endpoint |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Frontend (Vercel) | ⚠️ PARTIAL | [https://local-lift-2rcmac58y-admin-cleanexpo247s-projects.vercel.app/](https://local-lift-2rcmac58y-admin-cleanexpo247s-projects.vercel.app/) |
| Backend (Railway) | ✅ OPERATIONAL | [https://humorous-serenity-locallift.up.railway.app/](https://humorous-serenity-locallift.up.railway.app/) |
| Database (Supabase) | ✅ OPERATIONAL | [https://rsooolwhapkkkwbmybdb.supabase.co](https://rsooolwhapkkkwbmybdb.supabase.co) |

## MCP-Powered Deployment Automation

We've set up a complete deployment automation system that enables:

1. **Automatic endpoint discovery** - Finds and verifies all deployment endpoints
2. **Configuration validation** - Ensures proper setup of environment variables
3. **Auto-fixing common issues** - Handles PORT configuration and API endpoints 
4. **Deployment verification** - Confirms all components are operational
5. **Regular monitoring** - Can be scheduled to run periodically

## Running the Automation Tools

The automation tools are located in the `LocalLift/deployment-automation` directory on your Desktop. 

### Important: Use Absolute Paths

When running scripts from a different directory, you must use absolute paths. For detailed instructions, see:
[ABSOLUTE_PATH_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./ABSOLUTE_PATH_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### Option 1: Standard Execution (Fixed Version)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\run_auto_deployment_fixed.ps1
```

> **Note**: Use the fixed version which prevents Unicode encoding errors. See [UNICODE_FIX_NOTES.md](./UNICODE_FIX_NOTES.md) for details.

### Option 2: Non-Interactive Mode (for CI/CD or Scheduled Tasks)

```powershell
# This uses the fixed scripts internally
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\run_automation_noninteractive.ps1
```

### Option 3: Set Up Scheduled Monitoring (requires admin rights)

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\setup_scheduled_task.ps1
```

## Configuration Files

Your API tokens and deployment configuration are stored in these files:

| File | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| `.env` | API Tokens | `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\.env` |
| `endpoints.json` | Detected Endpoints | `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\mcp-env\endpoints.json` |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Configuration

The authentication system has been configured to use the proper endpoints. If you experience authentication issues:

1. Verify browser console for any connection errors
2. The system now includes debug logging to help diagnose problems
3. Authentication connects to the backend at: `https://humorous-serenity-locallift.up.railway.app/api`
4. Supabase configuration is correctly set up for user management

### Frontend Deployment Issues

The Vercel deployment is showing authentication challenges. Several fixes have been attempted:

1. Added vercel.json configuration file with proper static site settings
2. Updated API endpoint references in auth.js to use the config values
3. Added debug logging to trace API connections
4. Modified environment variables in vercel.json

To resolve remaining issues, use the MCP-powered automation tools:

```powershell
# Navigate to the automation directory
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation

# Run the automated deployment fixer
.\run_auto_deployment_fixed.ps1
```

The automation will diagnose and fix common Vercel deployment issues, including permissions and configuration problems.

### Port Configuration Fixed

The PORT configuration has been resolved with the following actions:

1. All Railway PORT environment variables now correctly set
2. main.py has been configured to use the proper port binding
3. Backend API is now fully operational

### API Connection Issues

If frontend and backend are not connecting properly:

1. The auto-fixer automatically updates API endpoint configuration in config.js
2. Verify that CORS is properly configured in your backend
3. Check frontend console logs for API connection errors

## Frontend Enhancements & Current Status

Several improvements have been made to the frontend:

1. **Enhanced Navigation**:
   - Proper navigation bar added to the homepage
   - Login/signup buttons with clear design
   - Linked features to their respective dashboard pages

2. **Authentication Debugging**:
   - Added console logging for debugging authentication
   - APIs now properly connected to Railway backend
   - Error handling improved for login/signup operations

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Improved visual hierarchy
   - Better responsive design
   - Enhanced user flow from landing page to dashboard

## Using the Deployment Automation Tools

The project includes powerful MCP-based automation tools for deployment troubleshooting and fixing:

1. **Run Endpoint Discovery** to verify all endpoints:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift
   python .\mcp_endpoint_discovery.py
   ```

2. **Fix Deployment Issues** automatically:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
   .\run_auto_deployment_fixed.ps1
   ```

3. **Troubleshoot specific issues**:
   - For Vercel issues: `python .\deployment-automation\src\platforms\vercel.py --verify`
   - For Railway issues: `python .\deployment-automation\src\platforms\railway.py --verify`

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Vercel Deployment**:
   - Run the deployment automation tools to fix remaining issues
   - Use the simplified-vercel-deploy.ps1 script for a fresh deployment

2. **User Management**:
   - Set up superadmin role using guide in SUPERADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   - Import initial user data if needed

3. **Custom Domain Setup**:
   - Configure custom domain for Vercel deployment
   - Update API endpoint configuration accordingly

4. **Extend Automation**:
   - Additional scripts can be added to the `deployment-automation/src` directory
   - Customize monitoring thresholds in config files

## Available MCP Tools

The deployment automation leverages several MCP tools:

1. **Railway Platform Integration**: 
   - Manages Railway deployments, environment variables, and redeployments
   - Fixes common Railway configuration issues

2. **Vercel Platform Integration**:
   - Updates Vercel environment variables and configurations
   - Verifies frontend deployments and triggers rebuilds

3. **Endpoint Discovery**:
   - Detects and validates all deployment endpoints
   - Generates comprehensive endpoint reports

4. **Auto Deployment Fixer**:
   - Fixes common deployment issues automatically
   - Updates configuration files to match the current environment

## Logs and Reporting

Detailed logs are stored in:
- `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\deployment-logs\`

Summary reports are generated in:
- `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\mcp-env\`
