# LocalLift Deployment Completion Guide

**Date: April 20, 2025**  
**Version: 1.0.0**

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for managing and maintaining your LocalLift deployment infrastructure using the automated MCP (Model Context Protocol) powered tooling that has been set up.

## Current Deployment Status

| Component | Status | Endpoint |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Frontend (Vercel) | ✅ OPERATIONAL | [https://locallift.vercel.app/](https://locallift.vercel.app/) |
| Backend (Railway) | ⚠️ NOT DETECTED | *No active endpoints found* |
| Database (Supabase) | ✅ OPERATIONAL | [https://supabase.co/dashboard/project/locallift/](https://supabase.co/dashboard/project/locallift/) |

## MCP-Powered Deployment Automation

We've set up a complete deployment automation system that enables:

1. **Automatic endpoint discovery** - Finds and verifies all deployment endpoints
2. **Configuration validation** - Ensures proper setup of environment variables
3. **Auto-fixing common issues** - Handles PORT configuration and API endpoints 
4. **Deployment verification** - Confirms all components are operational
5. **Regular monitoring** - Can be scheduled to run periodically

## Running the Automation Tools

The automation tools are located in the `LocalLift/deployment-automation` directory on your Desktop. 

### Important: Use Absolute Paths

When running scripts from a different directory, you must use absolute paths. For detailed instructions, see:
[ABSOLUTE_PATH_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./ABSOLUTE_PATH_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### Option 1: Standard Execution (Fixed Version)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\run_auto_deployment_fixed.ps1
```

> **Note**: Use the fixed version which prevents Unicode encoding errors. See [UNICODE_FIX_NOTES.md](./UNICODE_FIX_NOTES.md) for details.

### Option 2: Non-Interactive Mode (for CI/CD or Scheduled Tasks)

```powershell
# This uses the fixed scripts internally
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\run_automation_noninteractive.ps1
```

### Option 3: Set Up Scheduled Monitoring (requires admin rights)

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\setup_scheduled_task.ps1
```

## Configuration Files

Your API tokens and deployment configuration are stored in these files:

| File | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| `.env` | API Tokens | `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\.env` |
| `endpoints.json` | Detected Endpoints | `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\mcp-env\endpoints.json` |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Railway Backend Not Detected

If the Railway backend is not detected, check the following:

1. Verify your Railway project is properly deployed
2. Check if your Railway API token is valid
3. Try running the endpoint discovery tool again:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
   python src\mcp_endpoint_discovery.py
   ```

### Port Configuration Issues

If you're experiencing PORT-related errors in Railway deployment:

1. The auto-fixer will automatically check and fix PORT configuration in main.py
2. Verify that the `PORT` environment variable is set in Railway dashboard
3. Check Railway logs for any port binding issues

### API Connection Issues

If frontend and backend are not connecting properly:

1. The auto-fixer automatically updates API endpoint configuration in config.js
2. Verify that CORS is properly configured in your backend
3. Check frontend console logs for API connection errors

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Railway Backend Deployment**:
   - Once deployed, run the automation tools again to detect and configure it

2. **Set Up Regular Monitoring**:
   - Use the scheduled task script to monitor deployment health
   - Set email notifications for any issues

3. **Extend Automation**:
   - Additional scripts can be added to the `deployment-automation/src` directory
   - Customize monitoring thresholds in config files

## Available MCP Tools

The deployment automation leverages several MCP tools:

1. **Railway Platform Integration**: 
   - Manages Railway deployments, environment variables, and redeployments
   - Fixes common Railway configuration issues

2. **Vercel Platform Integration**:
   - Updates Vercel environment variables and configurations
   - Verifies frontend deployments and triggers rebuilds

3. **Endpoint Discovery**:
   - Detects and validates all deployment endpoints
   - Generates comprehensive endpoint reports

4. **Auto Deployment Fixer**:
   - Fixes common deployment issues automatically
   - Updates configuration files to match the current environment

## Logs and Reporting

Detailed logs are stored in:
- `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\deployment-logs\`

Summary reports are generated in:
- `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\mcp-env\`
