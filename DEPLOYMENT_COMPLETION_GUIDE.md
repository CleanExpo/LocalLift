## MCP-Powered Deployment Automation

We've set up a complete deployment automation system that enables:

1. **Automatic endpoint discovery** - Finds and verifies all deployment endpoints
2. **Configuration validation** - Ensures proper setup of environment variables
3. **Auto-fixing common issues** - Handles PORT configuration and API endpoints 
4. **Deployment verification** - Confirms all components are operational
5. **Regular monitoring** - Can be scheduled to run periodically

## Running the Automation Tools

The automation tools are located in the `LocalLift/deployment-automation` directory on your Desktop. 

### Important: Use Absolute Paths

When running scripts from a different directory, you must use absolute paths. For detailed instructions, see:
[ABSOLUTE_PATH_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./ABSOLUTE_PATH_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### Option 1: Standard Execution (Fixed Version)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\run_auto_deployment_fixed.ps1
```

> **Note**: Use the fixed version which prevents Unicode encoding errors. See [UNICODE_FIX_NOTES.md](./UNICODE_FIX_NOTES.md) for details.

### Option 2: Non-Interactive Mode (for CI/CD or Scheduled Tasks)

```powershell
# This uses the fixed scripts internally
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\run_automation_noninteractive.ps1
```

### Option 3: Set Up Scheduled Monitoring (requires admin rights)

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\setup_scheduled_task.ps1
```

## Configuration Files

Your API tokens and deployment configuration are stored in these files:

| File | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| `.env` | API Tokens | `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\.env` |
| `endpoints.json` | Detected Endpoints | `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\mcp-env\endpoints.json` |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Configuration

The authentication system has been configured to use the proper endpoints. If you experience authentication issues:

1. Verify browser console for any connection errors
2. The system now includes debug logging to help diagnose problems
3. Authentication connects to the backend at: `https://humorous-serenity-locallift.up.railway.app/api`
4. Supabase configuration is correctly set up for user management

### Deployment Status: Complete ✅

All components have been successfully deployed and verified:

1. **Vercel Frontend**: 
   - Successfully deployed with simplified configuration
   - Using correct API endpoint references
   - Deployed with proper vercel.json settings
   - Static content is serving correctly

2. **Railway Backend**:
   - API is operational at the health endpoint
   - PORT configuration is correctly set
   - Database connection is properly configured

3. **Supabase Database**:
   - Schema correctly applied
   - Connection from backend verified
   - Authentication system properly configured

### Port Configuration Fixed

The PORT configuration has been resolved with the following actions:

1. All Railway PORT environment variables now correctly set
2. main.py has been configured to use the proper port binding
3. Backend API is now fully operational

### API Connection Issues

If frontend and backend are not connecting properly:

1. The auto-fixer automatically updates API endpoint configuration in config.js
2. Verify that CORS is properly configured in your backend
3. Check frontend console logs for API connection errors

## Frontend Enhancements & Current Status

Several improvements have been made to the frontend:

1. **Enhanced Navigation**:
   - Proper navigation bar added to the homepage
   - Login/signup buttons with clear design
   - Linked features to their respective dashboard pages

2. **Authentication Debugging**:
   - Added console logging for debugging authentication
   - APIs now properly connected to Railway backend
   - Error handling improved for login/signup operations

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Improved visual hierarchy
   - Better responsive design
   - Enhanced user flow from landing page to dashboard

## Deployment Resolution Process

The following steps were taken to successfully deploy the application:

1. **Automated Diagnostics**:
   - Ran the automated deployment fixer to detect and correct issues
   - Identified and fixed API endpoint configuration
   - Verified connectivity between all components

2. **Vercel Configuration**:
   - Updated vercel.json to use rewrites instead of routes
   - Fixed configuration to work with Vercel's latest requirements
   - Simplified the deployment with direct-deploy script

3. **API Connectivity**:
   - Ensured proper Railway backend connections
   - Verified health endpoint is responding correctly
   - Configuration validated across all components

The MCP-powered automation tools provided crucial assistance in diagnosing and fixing deployment issues. These tools can be used for ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting:

```powershell
# For diagnostics and verification
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\run_auto_deployment_fixed.ps1
```

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize Domain Configuration**:
   - Set up custom domain in Vercel dashboard
   - Update DNS records as needed
   - Update API references if domain changes

2. **User Management**:
   - Set up superadmin role using guide in SUPERADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   - Import initial user data if needed
   - Verify permissions are working correctly

3. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Configure ongoing monitoring for the deployment
   - Set up automated health checks
   - Consider implementing the scheduled tasks from the automation tools:
     ```powershell
     # Set up automated checks
     cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
     .\setup_scheduled_task.ps1
     ```

4. **Feature Expansion**:
   - Implement additional features as outlined in PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
   - Leverage the existing automation for future deployments
   - Use the MCP tools for ongoing maintenance

## Available MCP Tools

The deployment automation leverages several MCP tools:

1. **Railway Platform Integration**: 
   - Manages Railway deployments, environment variables, and redeployments
   - Fixes common Railway configuration issues

2. **Vercel Platform Integration**:
   - Updates Vercel environment variables and configurations
   - Verifies frontend deployments and triggers rebuilds

3. **Endpoint Discovery**:
   - Detects and validates all deployment endpoints
   - Generates comprehensive endpoint reports

4. **Auto Deployment Fixer**:
   - Fixes common deployment issues automatically
   - Updates configuration files to match the current environment

## Logs and Reporting

Detailed logs are stored in:
- `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\deployment-logs\`

Summary reports are generated in:
- `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\mcp-env\`
