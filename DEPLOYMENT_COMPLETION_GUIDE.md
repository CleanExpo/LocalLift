# LocalLift Deployment Completion Guide

**Date: April 20, 2025**  
**Version: 1.1.0**

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for managing and maintaining your LocalLift deployment infrastructure using the automated MCP (Model Context Protocol) powered tooling that has been set up.

## Current Deployment Status

| Component | Status | Endpoint |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Frontend (Vercel) | ✅ OPERATIONAL | [https://local-lift-eyewzn9wp-admin-cleanexpo247s-projects.vercel.app/](https://local-lift-eyewzn9wp-admin-cleanexpo247s-projects.vercel.app/) |
| Backend (Railway) | ✅ OPERATIONAL | [https://humorous-serenity-locallift.up.railway.app/](https://humorous-serenity-locallift.up.railway.app/) |
| Database (Supabase) | ✅ OPERATIONAL | [https://rsooolwhapkkkwbmybdb.supabase.co](https://rsooolwhapkkkwbmybdb.supabase.co) |

## MCP-Powered Deployment Automation

We've set up a complete deployment automation system that enables:

1. **Automatic endpoint discovery** - Finds and verifies all deployment endpoints
2. **Configuration validation** - Ensures proper setup of environment variables
3. **Auto-fixing common issues** - Handles PORT configuration and API endpoints 
4. **Deployment verification** - Confirms all components are operational
5. **Regular monitoring** - Can be scheduled to run periodically

## Running the Automation Tools

The automation tools are located in the `LocalLift/deployment-automation` directory on your Desktop. 

### Important: Use Absolute Paths

When running scripts from a different directory, you must use absolute paths. For detailed instructions, see:
[ABSOLUTE_PATH_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./ABSOLUTE_PATH_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### Option 1: Standard Execution (Fixed Version)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\run_auto_deployment_fixed.ps1
```

> **Note**: Use the fixed version which prevents Unicode encoding errors. See [UNICODE_FIX_NOTES.md](./UNICODE_FIX_NOTES.md) for details.

### Option 2: Non-Interactive Mode (for CI/CD or Scheduled Tasks)

```powershell
# This uses the fixed scripts internally
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\run_automation_noninteractive.ps1
```

### Option 3: Set Up Scheduled Monitoring (requires admin rights)

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
cd C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation
.\setup_scheduled_task.ps1
```

## Configuration Files

Your API tokens and deployment configuration are stored in these files:

| File | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| `.env` | API Tokens | `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\.env` |
| `endpoints.json` | Detected Endpoints | `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\mcp-env\endpoints.json` |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Configuration

The authentication system has been configured to use the proper endpoints. If you experience authentication issues:

1. Verify browser console for any connection errors
2. The system now includes debug logging to help diagnose problems
3. Authentication connects to the backend at: `https://humorous-serenity-locallift.up.railway.app/api`
4. Supabase configuration is correctly set up for user management

### Port Configuration Fixed

The PORT configuration has been resolved with the following actions:

1. All Railway PORT environment variables now correctly set
2. main.py has been configured to use the proper port binding
3. Backend API is now fully operational

### API Connection Issues

If frontend and backend are not connecting properly:

1. The auto-fixer automatically updates API endpoint configuration in config.js
2. Verify that CORS is properly configured in your backend
3. Check frontend console logs for API connection errors

## Frontend Enhancements

Several improvements have been made to the frontend:

1. **Enhanced Navigation**:
   - Proper navigation bar added to the homepage
   - Login/signup buttons with clear design
   - Linked features to their respective dashboard pages

2. **Authentication Debugging**:
   - Added console logging for debugging authentication
   - APIs now properly connected to Railway backend
   - Error handling improved for login/signup operations

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Improved visual hierarchy
   - Better responsive design
   - Enhanced user flow from landing page to dashboard

## Next Steps

1. **User Management**:
   - Set up superadmin role using guide in SUPERADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   - Import initial user data if needed

2. **Custom Domain Setup**:
   - Configure custom domain for Vercel deployment
   - Update API endpoint configuration accordingly

3. **Extend Automation**:
   - Additional scripts can be added to the `deployment-automation/src` directory
   - Customize monitoring thresholds in config files

## Available MCP Tools

The deployment automation leverages several MCP tools:

1. **Railway Platform Integration**: 
   - Manages Railway deployments, environment variables, and redeployments
   - Fixes common Railway configuration issues

2. **Vercel Platform Integration**:
   - Updates Vercel environment variables and configurations
   - Verifies frontend deployments and triggers rebuilds

3. **Endpoint Discovery**:
   - Detects and validates all deployment endpoints
   - Generates comprehensive endpoint reports

4. **Auto Deployment Fixer**:
   - Fixes common deployment issues automatically
   - Updates configuration files to match the current environment

## Logs and Reporting

Detailed logs are stored in:
- `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\deployment-logs\`

Summary reports are generated in:
- `C:\Users\PhillMcGurk\Desktop\LocalLift\deployment-automation\mcp-env\`
