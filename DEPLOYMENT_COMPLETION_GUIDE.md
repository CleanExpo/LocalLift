# LocalLift Deployment Completion Guide

This document outlines the successful deployment of the LocalLift application to both Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

## Completed Configuration

### Backend Configuration (Railway)

1. **PORT Configuration Fixed**
   - Fixed the `main.py` file to correctly use the PORT environment variable
   - Updated `uvicorn.run()` parameters to avoid conflicts
   - Added logging to show which port the server is using
   - Removed duplicate health endpoint

2. **Railway Configuration**
   - Updated `railway.toml` with proper health check paths
   - Verified `Procfile` contains the correct web command

3. **Railway Domain**
   - Created Railway domain: https://humorous-serenity-locallift.up.railway.app
   - Verified health endpoint is working at https://humorous-serenity-locallift.up.railway.app/health

### Frontend Configuration (Vercel)

1. **API Integration**
   - Updated frontend configuration to point to the new Railway domain:
   - Changed API_BASE_URL from the old URL to: https://humorous-serenity-locallift.up.railway.app/api
   - Deployed changes to Vercel

2. **Frontend URL**
   - The application is deployed at: https://local-lift-gptawvo91-admin-cleanexpo247s-projects.vercel.app

## Verification Steps

1. **Backend Health Check**
   - ✅ The backend health endpoint is responding with a 200 OK status
   - ✅ Content: "ok" - indicating the backend is running properly
   - ✅ Railway correctly binds to the PORT environment variable

2. **Frontend Connection**
   - ✅ Frontend is configured to communicate with the correct backend URL
   - ✅ Supabase integration is maintained with the correct credentials

## Next Steps and Maintenance

1. **Monitoring**
   - Regularly check Railway logs for any PORT-related issues
   - Monitor the health endpoint to ensure the application remains online

2. **Future Deployments**
   - Always use the PORT environment variable for service binding
   - Ensure the following files are up to date:
     - `railway.toml`
     - `Procfile`
     - `main.py` (with proper PORT configuration)
     - `public/js/config.js` (with correct backend URL)

3. **Troubleshooting**
   - If deployment issues recur, refer to the `RAILWAY_PORT_CONFIGURATION.md` file
   - For more detailed logs, check the Railway dashboard

## Summary

The LocalLift application has been successfully configured to work properly with Railway's PORT environment variable requirement. This ensures that the application is correctly exposed on Railway's public networking infrastructure, and the frontend can communicate with the backend API.
