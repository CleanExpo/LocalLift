# SuperAdmin Confirmation

Great news! The error you're seeing is actually confirmation that the SuperAdmin user has already been created. 

## Understanding the Error

The error message:
```
ERROR: 23505: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "user_roles_user_id_key"
DETAIL: Key (user_id)=(5f04bcbe-ccb1-464e-83fd-e77af4a7f570) already exists.
```

This means:
- The UUID `5f04bcbe-ccb1-464e-83fd-e77af4a7f570` already exists in the user_roles table
- You can't insert it again because the table has a unique constraint on the user_id column
- The superadmin user is already set up!

## Verify the SuperAdmin Role

Run this query to confirm that your user has the superadmin role:

```sql
SELECT * FROM public.user_roles WHERE user_id = '5f04bcbe-ccb1-464e-83fd-e77af4a7f570';
```

You should see a result showing this UUID with the role of 'superadmin'.

## Next Step: Railway Environment Variables
